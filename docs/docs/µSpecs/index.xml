      <description>Anatomy of a type µSpec #  The µType specs are regular yaml files.
The &amp;ldquo;type-object&amp;rdquo; contains 3 fields. The fields type, fields are mandatory, the field target is optional and autogenerated when ommited.
You can have as many type definitions per file as you want. It makes sense that you put types in a file, that belongs togehter.
File: muspec/sample.types.yaml
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  - type:&amp;#39;sample.</description>

      <description>Anatomy of a service µSpec #  The µService specs are regular yaml files.
The “service-object” contains 5 fields. The fields name, package and methods are mandatory, the field target and description is optional and autogenerated when ommited.
You can have as many service definitions per file as you want. It makes sense that you put types in a file, that belongs togehter.
The field methods in µServcies will translate to services in the standard notation for compatibility reasons, because the standard notation is some years old and changing this would be a breaking change we do not want to do at the moment.</description>

      <description>Anatomy of a enum µSpec #  The µType specs are regular yaml files.
The &amp;ldquo;enum-object&amp;rdquo; contains 4 fields. The fields enum, values are mandatory, the field target and alias are optional.
You can have as many enum definitions per file as you want. It makes sense that you put enums in a file, that belongs togehter.
It is not possible to mix enums and types in the same µSpec file at the moment.</description>
